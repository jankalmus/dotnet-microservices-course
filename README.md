**Microservices application** 

My goals: 
* Study microservices architecture
* Get (more) experience with Kubernetes, gRPC, Docker, RabbitMQ
* Test .NET web development on ARM-based machine 

Technologies used:
* .NET 7.0
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* RabbitMQ
* PostgreSQL
* gRPC
* NGINX ingress
* AutoMapper

Possible improvement points: more abstraction, event processing, TLS in the K8S cluster. 

This application is created for studying purposes based on Les Jackson's .NET Microservices course, available on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgVjEo3OGBI

Thank you Les Jackson for the time and effort put in this incredible, detailed and straightforward course.
